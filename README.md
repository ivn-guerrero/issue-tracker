# A vanilla JavaScript issue tracker

Mainly based on [this tutorial](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/pure-javascript-building-a-real-world-application-from-scratch-5213591cfcd6)

## Changes made by me:
- update the styling used in the form
- use an accordion and a different structure to display the issues
- use modern JavaScript (object destructuring and declarative loops)
- add a button to set and issue's state to open
